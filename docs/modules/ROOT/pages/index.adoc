= Overview

Nile is a CLI tool to develop or interact with Starknet projects written in Cairo. It consists of different components for developing, compiling, testing, and deploying your smart contracts and dApps, providing a CLI for executing tasks, and a Runtime Environment (NRE) for scripting.

The package is designed to be extensible and very customizable by using plugins. This guide will take you through the installation of our recommended setup, but as we expect a lot of functionality coming from plugins, you are free to customize it.

You can get a list of plugins extending Nile functionality from the xref:plugins.adoc[Plugins] section.

== Requirements

=== Supported Python versions

Some Nile dependencies have specific python version requirements, therefore we recommend using a python version manager like {pyenv}, and virtual environments to avoid conflicts.

Current supported Python versions are >=3.8 and <3.10.

== Installation

Create a folder for your project and cd into it:

[,sh]
----
mkdir myproject && cd myproject
----

Create a virtualenv and activate it:

[,sh]
----
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
----

Install Nile:

[,sh]
----
(env): pip install cairo-nile
----

Use Nile to quickly set up your development environment:

[,sh]
----
(env): nile init
🗄 Creating project directory tree
⛵️ Nile project ready! Try running:

nile compile
----

`nile init` builds the project structure by:

- Creating directories for contracts and tests.
- Populating these directories with test modules.
- Generating a .env to store private key aliases.
- Setting up a node.json for initializing a local node.

This is the final structure:

[,sh]
----
├── contracts
│   └── contract.cairo
├── test
│   └── test_contract.py
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── Makefile
└── node.json
