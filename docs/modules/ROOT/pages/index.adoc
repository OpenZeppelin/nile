= Overview

Nile is a CLI tool to develop or interact with StarkNet projects written in Cairo. It consists of different components for developing, compiling, testing, and deploying your smart contracts and dApps, providing a xref:cli.adoc[CLI] for executing tasks, and a xref:scripts.adoc[Runtime Environment (NRE)] for scripting.

The package is designed to be extensible and very customizable by using plugins. This guide will take you through the installation of our recommended setup, but as we expect a lot of functionality coming from plugins, you are free to customize it.

== Quickstart

Using a sample contract, we will explore the basics of creating a Nile project. We will test it locally, deploy an account and the contract to a devnet node, and send transactions through the account to the contract.

=== Requirements

==== GMP for fastecdsa

Before installing Cairo on your machine, you need to install `gmp`:

[,bash]
----
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev # linux
or
brew install gmp # mac
----

TIP: If you have any trouble installing gmp on your Apple M1 computer, https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/issues/22[here's a list of potential solutions].

==== Supported Python versions

Some Nile dependencies have specific python version requirements. Therefore we recommend using a python version manager like {pyenv}, and virtual environments to avoid conflicts.

IMPORTANT: Currently supported Python versions are >=3.8 and <3.10.

=== Installation

Create a folder for your project and cd into it:

[,sh]
----
mkdir myproject && cd myproject
----

Create a virtualenv and activate it:

[,sh]
----
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
----


Install Nile:

[,sh]
----
pip install cairo-nile
----

Use `nile init` to quickly set up your development environment:

[,sh]
----
nile init
----

[,sh]
----
🗄 Creating project directory tree
⛵️ Nile project ready! Try running:

nile compile
----

=== Testing

`nile init` creates a sample Cairo contract and test for you. Check `contracts/contract.cairo` and `tests/test_contract.py` for the source code.

Run `pytest` to run the test suite against the Smart Contracts:

[,sh]
----
pytest tests/
----

TIP: For a more in-deep guide on testing with parallelism and coverage, check our xref:testing.adoc[testing guide].

=== Compiling

Use `nile compile` to compile contracts under the `contracts/` folder by default.

[,sh]
----
nile compile
----

[,sh]
----
🤖 Compiling all Cairo contracts in the contracts directory
🔨 Compiling contracts/contract.cairo
✅ Done
----

TIP: For a full reference of Nile command options, check the xref:cli.adoc[CLI Reference] section.

=== Interacting with Starknet

==== Running a local node

By default, nile commands interacting directly with starknet nodes assume that you are using a local one if you don't specify the network using the `--network` option (default to `localhost`).

Use `nile node` to run a local devnet node for development.

[,sh]
----
nile node
----

==== Deploying an account

. Add an environment variable with the account's private key to the `.env` file.
+
[,sh]
----
# .env
ACCOUNT_1 = 0x1234
----
+
CAUTION: Don't use this private key in production environments!
+
. Use `nile counterfactual-address` to precompute the deployment address of the Account contract for the given signer.
+
[,sh]
----
nile counterfactual-address ACCOUNT_1 --salt 123
----
+
NOTE: Different salts compute to different addresses, even with the same private key.
+
. Estimate the fee for executing the transaction.
+
[,sh]
----
nile setup ACCOUNT_1 --salt 123 --estimate_fee
----
+
[,sh]
----
The estimated fee is: 52147932632842 WEI (0.000052 ETH).
Gas usage: 5063
Gas price: 10299808934 WEI
----
+
In production, you will need to fund the counterfactual address with Ether to pay for the deployment fees, which will be mandatory in testnets soon. There are multiple bridges and faucets, like link:https://goerli.starkgate.starknet.io/[Starkgate] being implemented at the moment to support the developer experience.
+
For local development using a devnet node, you can use predeployed accounts to fund your address by using xref:scripts.adoc#transfer_funds_from_a_predeployed_devnet_account[this script].
+
. After funding the precomputed address, deploy the account using `nile setup`.
+
[,sh]
----
nile setup ACCOUNT_1 --salt 123 --max_fee 52147932632842
----
+
NOTE: Nile will estimate the `max_fee` by default if this option is not set. This is valid for other commands
involving transaction execution, like `declare`, `send`, or `deploy`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
In StarkNet, users can deploy only previously declared contracts. {oz-account} is declared soon after every release in devnet, testnets and mainnet, but there could be an out-of-sync period between account update release and devnet release. Then you can declare the OZ Account using predeployed accounts through scripts.

Check xref:scripts.adoc#declare_account[Declare the OZ Account] script.
====

==== Deploying a contract

. First, declare the contract to register the class hash on the network. You only need to do this once as long as the contract bytecode doesn't change.
+
[,sh]
----
nile declare ACCOUNT_1 contract
----
+
. Use `nile deploy` to deploy the contract.
+
[,sh]
----
nile deploy ACCOUNT_1 contract --alias my_contract
----
+
NOTE: The alias option allows you to interact with the contract later without using the address.

==== Reading from a contract

Use `nile call` to read from a contract view function.

[,sh]
----
nile call my_contract get_balance
----

==== Writing to a contract

Use `nile send` to execute a transaction.

[,sh]
----
nile send ACCOUNT_1 my_contract increase_balance 2
----
