= Overview

Nile is a CLI tool to develop or interact with StarkNet projects written in Cairo. It consists of different components for developing, compiling, testing, and deploying your smart contracts and dApps, providing a xref:commands.adoc[CLI] for executing tasks, and a xref:nre.adoc[Runtime Environment (NRE)] for scripting.

The package is designed to be extensible and very customizable by using plugins. This guide will take you through the installation of our recommended setup, but as we expect a lot of functionality coming from plugins, you are free to customize it.

TIP: You can get a list of plugins extending Nile functionality from the xref:plugins.adoc[Plugins] section.

== Quickstart

Using a sample contract, we will explore the basics of creating a Nile project. We will test it locally, deploy an account and the contract to a devnet node, and send transactions through the account to the contract.

=== Requirements

==== GMP for fastecdsa

Before installing Cairo on your machine, you need to install `gmp`:

[,bash]
----
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev # linux
brew install gmp # mac
----

TIP: If you have any trouble installing gmp on your Apple M1 computer, https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/issues/22[here's a list of potential solutions].

==== Supported Python versions

Some Nile dependencies have specific python version requirements. Therefore we recommend using a python version manager like {pyenv}, and virtual environments to avoid conflicts.

IMPORTANT: Currently supported Python versions are >=3.8 and <3.10.

=== Installation

Create a folder for your project and cd into it:

[,sh]
----
mkdir myproject && cd myproject
----

Create a virtualenv and activate it:

[,sh]
----
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
----

IMPORTANT: Review xref:index.adoc#requirements[Requirements]

Install Nile:

[,sh]
----
(env): pip install cairo-nile
----

Use `nile init` to quickly set up your development environment:

[,sh]
----
(env): nile init
🗄 Creating project directory tree
⛵️ Nile project ready! Try running:

nile compile
----

=== Testing

`nile init` creates a sample Cairo contract and test for you. Check *contracts/contract.cairo* and *tests/test_contract.py* for the source code.

Run `pytest` to run the test suite against the Smart Contracts:

[,sh]
----
(env): pytest tests/
----

TIP: For a more in-deep guide on testing with parallelism and coverage, check our xref:testing.adoc[Testing] guide.

=== Compiling

Use `nile compile` to compile contracts under the *contracts/* folder by default.

[,sh]
----
(env): nile compile
🤖 Compiling all Cairo contracts in the contracts directory
🔨 Compiling contracts/contract.cairo
✅ Done
----

TIP: For a full reference of Nile command options, check the xref:commands.adoc[CLI Reference] section.

=== Deploying an account

. Add an environment variable with the Account Private Key to the *.env* file.
+
[,sh]
----
# .env
ACCOUNT_1 = 0x1234
----
+
CAUTION: Don't use this Private Key in production environments!
+
. Use `nile counterfactual-address` to precompute the deployment address of the Account contract for the given signer.
+
[,sh]
----
(env): nile counterfactual-address ACCOUNT_1 --salt 123
0x057792c44b1e9e349ee549ed018f7225f927bd2b01b6277a1cb94da5fb9421ed
----
+
NOTE: Different salts compute to different addresses, even with the same Private Key.
+
. In production, you will need to fund this address with Ether to pay for the deployment fees, which will be mandatory in testnets soon. There are multiple bridges and faucets, like link:https://goerli.starkgate.starknet.io/[Starkgate] being implemented at the moment to support the developer experience.
+
. After funding the precomputed address, deploy the account using `nile setup`.
+
[,sh]
----
(env): nile setup ACCOUNT_1 --salt 123
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
In StarkNet, users can deploy only previously declared contracts. {oz-account} is declared soon after every release in testnets and mainnet, but the local devnet needs a declaration for every instance, because the contract is not declared by default; however, you need an account to execute a declare transaction. To solve this egg-chicken problem, you can declare the OZ Account in devnet using predeployed accounts through scripts.

Check xref:scripts.adoc#declare_account[Declare Account] guide.
====

=== Deploying a contract

. First, declare the contract to register the class hash on the network. You only need to do this once as long as the contract bytecode doesn't change.
+
[,sh]
----
(env): nile declare ACCOUNT_1 contract
----
+
. Use `nile deploy` to deploy the contract.
+
[,sh]
----
(env): nile deploy ACCOUNT_1 contract --alias my_contract
----
+
NOTE: The alias option allows you to interact with the contract later without using the address.

=== Reading from a contract

Use `nile call` to read from a contract view function.

[,sh]
----
(env): nile call my_contract get_balance

0
----

=== Writing to a contract

Use `nile send` to execute a transaction.

[,sh]
----
(env): nile send ACCOUNT_1 my_contract increase_balance 2
----
