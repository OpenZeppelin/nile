= Useful Script Examples
:sectnums:
Here you can find some potentially useful script examples.

[#declare_account]
== Declare Account

Useful if you need to deploy an account in devnet, for previous declaration:

[,python]
----
# script.py
async def run(nre):
  accounts = await nre.get_accounts(predeployed=True)
  declarer_account = accounts[0]
  print(await declarer_account.declare("Account"))
----

NOTE: This script assumes there is an link:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/tree/main/src/nile/artifacts[Account artifact] in your project. You can add the contract to the contracts folder, and compile with `nile compile` to get the artifact.

== Transfer funds from predeployed devnet account

Useful for funding addresses in devnet:

[,python]
----
from nile.common import ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS

async def run(nre):
    accounts = await nre.get_accounts(predeployed=True)
    account = accounts[0]

    # define the recipient address
    recipient = "0x053edde5384e39bad137d3c4130c708fb96ee28a4c80bf28049c486d3f369"

    # define the amount to transfer (uint256 format)
    amount = [2 * 10 ** 18, 0]

    print(f"Transferring {amount} to {recipient} from {hex(account.address)}")

    # send the transfer transaction
    output = await account.send(ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS, "transfer", [recipient, *amount])
    print(output)
