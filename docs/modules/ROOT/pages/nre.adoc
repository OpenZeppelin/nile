= NRE and Scripting

Nile provides a Runtime Environment for scripting that you can use for multiple tasks. The Script is any python file implementing an asynchronous `run(nre)` function to receive a NileRuntimeEnvironment object exposing Nile's scripting API.

== Running a script

. Create a file named *test_script.py* in the root directory of your project.
+
[,python]
----
async def run(nre):
    accounts = await nre.get_accounts(predeployed=True)
    print("First Account", accounts[0])
----
+
. Run a devnet node with `nile node`
+
[,sh]
----
(env): nile node
----
+
. Run the script by running `nile run "path/to/script.py"`
+
[,sh]
----
(env): nile run test_script.py
----

TIP: Change the script's target network with the `--network` option.
