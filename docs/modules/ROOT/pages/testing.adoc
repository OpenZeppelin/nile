= Testing with Nile

With Nile, you will usually use link:https://docs.pytest.org/[pytest] and {starknet-testing} frameworks for testing, even when it's framework agnostic and doesn't interfere with other tools.

NOTE: Keep in mind that different modules for testing can be integrated in the future through plugins.

== Overview

Here's the example test file provided in the base project (created by `nile init`):

[,python]
----
"""contract.cairo test file."""
import os

import pytest
from starkware.starknet.testing.starknet import Starknet

# The path to the contract source code.
CONTRACT_FILE = os.path.join("contracts", "contract.cairo")


# The testing library uses python's asyncio. So the following
# decorator and the ``async`` keyword are needed.
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_increase_balance():
    """Test increase_balance method."""
    # Create a new StarkNet class that simulates the StarkNet
    # system.
    starknet = await Starknet.empty()

    # Deploy the contract.
    contract = await starknet.deploy(
        source=CONTRACT_FILE,
    )

    # Invoke increase_balance() twice.
    await contract.increase_balance(amount=10).execute()
    await contract.increase_balance(amount=20).execute()

    # Check the result of get_balance().
    execution_info = await contract.get_balance().call()
    assert execution_info.result == (30,)
----

Following the pytest requirements, test files must start with `test_` or end with `_test`. You can run the test suite by running pytest.

[,sh]
----
pytest
----

TIP: For a reference on how to test complex projects, you can check the link:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts[cairo-contracts] repository.

== Handling slow tests

An issue we are very aware of, is how slow running tests can become when you have a considerable amount of them. We strongly recommend using link:https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[pytest-xdist] to speed up the process.

=== Parallelism with xdist

. Install pytest-xdist in your project.
+
[,sh]
----
python -m pip install pytest-xdist
----
+
. Add a `pytest.ini` file in the root of your project with the following configuration:
+
[,sh]
----
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
addopts = -n auto
----
. Done! Now each time you run tests with `pytest`, they will run in parallel, significantly speeding up the process.

== Coverage Reports

By default, Nile doesn't support coverage reports, but you can use link:https://github.com/ericnordelo/nile-coverage[nile-coverage] plugin to integrate this feature easily.

. Install nile-coverage in your project.
+
[,sh]
----
python -m pip install nile-coverage
----
+
. Use coverage command (from the plugin) to generate a coverage report.
+
[,sh]
----
nile coverage

Filename                    Stmts    Miss  Cover    Missing
------------------------  -------  ------  -------  ---------
contracts/contract.cairo        8       0  100.00%
TOTAL                           8       0  100.00%
----
+
. Done!

TIP: With nile-coverage, you can easily integrate with tools like link:https://codecov.io[Codecov]. Check the link:https://github.com/ericnordelo/nile-coverage/blob/main/README.md[plugin documentation] for a reference to the options.
