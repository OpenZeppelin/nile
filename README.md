# OpenZeppelin Nile ‚õµ

[![Tests and linter](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

_Navigate your [StarkNet](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/index.html) projects written in [Cairo](https://cairo-lang.org)._

## Getting started

Create a folder for your project and `cd` into it:

```sh
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
```

Create a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and activate it:

```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install `nile`:

```sh
pip install cairo-nile
```

Use `nile` to quickly set up your development environment:

```sh
nile init
...
‚ú®  Cairo successfully installed!
...
‚úÖ Dependencies successfully installed
üóÑ  Creating project directory tree
‚õµÔ∏è Nile project ready! Try running:
```

This command creates the project directory structure and installs `cairo-lang`, `starknet-devnet`, `pytest`, and `pytest-asyncio` for you. The template includes a makefile to build the project (`make build`) and run tests (`make test`).

## Usage

### `node`

Run a local [`starknet-devnet`](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/) node:

```text
nile node [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--seed SEED] [--lite_mode]

optional arguments:
--host HOST         Specify the address to listen at; defaults to
                    127.0.0.1 (use the address the program outputs on
                    start)
--port PORT         Specify the port to listen at; defaults to 5050
--seed SEED         Specify the seed for randomness of accounts to be
                    deployed
--lite-mode         Applies all lite-mode optimizations by disabling
                    features such as block hash and deploy hash
                    calculation
```

```text
nile node

 * Listening on http://127.0.0.1:5050/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### `compile`

Compile Cairo contracts. Compilation artifacts are written into the `artifacts/` directory.

```sh
nile compile # compiles all contracts under contracts/
nile compile --directory my_contracts # compiles all contracts under my_contracts/
nile compile contracts/MyContract.cairo # compiles single contract
nile compile contracts/MyContract.cairo --disable-hint-validation # compiles single contract with unwhitelisted hints
```

As of cairo-lang v0.8.0, account contracts (contracts with the `__execute__` method) must be compiled with the `--account_contract` flag. Nile automatically inserts the flag if the contract's name ends with `Account` i.e. Account.cairo, EthAccount.cairo. Otherwise, the flag must be included by the user.

```sh
nile compile contracts/NewAccountType.cairo --account_contract # compiles account contract
```

Example output:

```sh
$ nile compile
Creating artifacts/abis/ to store compilation artifacts
ü§ñ Compiling all Cairo contracts in the contracts/ directory
üî® Compiling contracts/Account.cairo
üî® Compiling contracts/Initializable.cairo
üî® Compiling contracts/Ownable.cairo
‚úÖ Done
```

### `deploy`

```sh
nile deploy contract --alias my_contract

üöÄ Deploying contract
üåï artifacts/contract.json successfully deployed to 0x07ec10eb0758f7b1bc5aed0d5b4d30db0ab3c087eba85d60858be46c1a5e4680
üì¶ Registering deployment as my_contract in localhost.deployments.txt
```

A few things to notice here:

1. `nile deploy <contract_name>` looks for an artifact with the same name
2. This created a `localhost.deployments.txt` file storing all data related to my deployment
3. The `--alias` parameter lets me create a unique identifier for future interactions, if no alias is set then the contract's address can be used as identifier
4. By default Nile works on local, but you can use the `--network` parameter to interact with `mainnet`, `goerli`, and the default `localhost`.
5. By default, the ABI corresponding to the contract will be registered with the deployment. To register a different ABI file, use the `--abi` parameter.

### `declare`

```sh
nile declare contract --alias my_contract

üöÄ Declaring contract
‚è≥ Declaration of contract successfully sent at 0x07ec10eb0758f7b1bc5aed0d5b4d30db0ab3c087eba85d60858be46c1a5e4680
üì¶ Registering declaration as my_contract in localhost.declarations.txt
```

A few things to notice here:

1. `nile declare <contract_name>` looks for an artifact with the same name
2. This created a `localhost.declarations.txt` file storing all data related to my declarations
3. The `--alias` parameter lets me create a unique identifier for future interactions, if no alias is set then the contract's address can be used as identifier
4. By default Nile works on local, but you can use the `--network` parameter to interact with `mainnet`, `goerli`, and the default `localhost`.

### `setup`

Deploy an Account associated with a given private key.

To avoid accidentally leaking private keys, this command takes an alias instead of the actual private key. This alias is associated with an environmental variable of the same name, whose value is the actual private key.

You can find an example `.env` file in `example.env`. These are private keys only to be used for testing and never in production.

```sh
nile setup <private_key_alias>

üöÄ Deploying Account
üåï artifacts/Account.json successfully deployed to 0x07db6b52c8ab888183277bc6411c400136fe566c0eebfb96fffa559b2e60e794
üì¶ Registering deployment as account-0 in localhost.deployments.txt
Invoke transaction was sent.
Contract address: 0x07db6b52c8ab888183277bc6411c400136fe566c0eebfb96fffa559b2e60e794
Transaction hash: 0x17
```

A few things to notice here:

1. `nile setup <private_key_alias>` looks for an environment variable with the name of the private key alias
2. This creates a `localhost.accounts.json` file storing all data related to accounts management

### `send`

Execute a transaction through the `Account` associated with the private key provided. The syntax is:

```sh
nile send <private_key_alias> <contract_identifier> <method> [PARAM_1, PARAM2...]
```

For example:

```sh
nile send <private_key_alias> ownable0 transfer_ownership 0x07db6...60e794

Invoke transaction was sent.
Contract address: 0x07db6b52c8ab888183277bc6411c400136fe566c0eebfb96fffa559b2e60e794
Transaction hash: 0x1c
```

Some things to note:

- `max_fee` defaults to `0`. Add `--max_fee <max_fee>` to set the maximum fee for the transaction
- `network` defaults to the `localhost`. Add `--network <network>` to change the network for the transaction

### `call` and `invoke`

Using `call` and `invoke`, we can perform read and write operations against our local node (or public one using the `--network mainnet` parameter). The syntax is:

```sh
nile <command> <contract_identifier> <method> [PARAM_1, PARAM2...]
```

Where `<command>` is either `call` or `invoke` and `<contract_identifier>` is either our contract address or alias, as defined on `deploy`.

```sh
nile invoke my_contract increase_balance 1

Invoke transaction was sent.
Contract address: 0x07ec10eb0758f7b1bc5aed0d5b4d30db0ab3c087eba85d60858be46c1a5e4680
Transaction hash: 0x1
```

```sh
nile call my_contract get_balance

1
```

Please note:

- `network` defaults to the `localhost`. Add `--network <network>` to change the network for the transaction

### `run`

Execute a script in the context of Nile. The script must implement a `run(nre)` function to receive a `NileRuntimeEnvironment` object exposing Nile's scripting API.

```python
# path/to/script.py

def run(nre):
    address, abi = nre.deploy("contract", alias="my_contract")
    print(abi, address)
```

Then run the script:

```sh
nile run path/to/script.py
```

Please note:

- `localhost` is the default network. Add `--network <network>` to change the network for the script

### `get_declaration` (NRE only)

Return the hash of a declared class. This can be useful in scenarios where a contract class is already declared with an alias prior to running a script.

```python
def run(nre):
    predeclared_class = nre.get_declaration("alias")
```

> Note that this command is only available in the context of scripting in the Nile Runtime Environment.

### `clean`

Deletes the `artifacts/` directory for a fresh start ‚ùÑÔ∏è

```sh
nile clean

üöÆ Deleting localhost.deployments.txt
üöÆ Deleting artifacts directory
‚ú® Workspace clean, keep going!
```

### `install`

Install the latest version of the Cairo language and the starknet-devnet local node.

```sh
nile install
```

### `version`

Print out the Nile version

```sh
nile version
```

### `debug`

Use locally available contracts to make error messages from rejected transactions more explicit.

```sh
nile debug <transaction_hash> [CONTRACTS_FILE, NETWORK]
```

For example, this transaction returns the very cryptic error message:  
`An ASSERT_EQ instruction failed: 0 != 1.`

```sh
starknet tx_status \
  --hash 0x57d2d844923f9fe5ef54ed7084df61f926b9a2a24eb5d7e46c8f6dbcd4baafe \
  --error_message

[...]
Error in the called contract (0x5bf05eece944b360ff0098eb9288e49bd0007e5a9ed80aefcb740e680e67ea4):
Error at pc=0:1360:
An ASSERT_EQ instruction failed: 0 != 1.
Cairo traceback (most recent call last):
Unknown location (pc=0:1384)
Unknown location (pc=0:1369)
```

This can be made more explicit with:

```sh
nile debug 0x57d2d844923f9fe5ef54ed7084df61f926b9a2a24eb5d7e46c8f6dbcd4baafe

‚è≥ Querying the network to check transaction status and identify contracts...
üßæ Found contracts: ['0x05bf05eece944b360ff0098eb9288e49bd0007e5a9ed80aefcb740e680e67ea4:artifacts/Evaluator.json']
‚è≥ Querying the network with contracts...
üßæ Error message:

func set_teacher{
     ^*********^
[path_to_file]:189:5
    only_teacher()
    ^************^
```

In case of pending transaction states, the command will offer to continue probing the network unless it
is terminated prematurely.
This example also shows how accepted transactions are handled.

```sh
‚è≥ Querying the network to check transaction status and identify contracts...
üïí Transaction status: NOT_RECEIVED. Trying again in a moment...
üïí Transaction status: RECEIVED. Trying again in a moment...
üïí Transaction status: PENDING. Trying again in a moment...
‚úÖ Transaction status: ACCEPTED_ON_L2. No error in transaction.
```

Finally, the command will use the local `network.deployments.txt` files to fetch the available contracts.  
However, it is also possible to override this by passing a `CONTRACTS_FILE` argument, formatted as:

```sh
CONTRACT_ADDRESS1:PATH_TO_COMPILED_CONTRACT1.json
CONTRACT_ADDRESS2:PATH_TO_COMPILED_CONTRACT2.json
...
```

### `get-accounts`

Retrieves a list of ready-to-use accounts which allows for easy scripting integration. Before using `get-accounts`:

1. store private keys in a `.env`

    ```
    PRIVATE_KEY_ALIAS_1=286426666527820764590699050992975838532
    PRIVATE_KEY_ALIAS_2=263637040172279991633704324379452721903
    PRIVATE_KEY_ALIAS_3=325047780196174231475632140485641889884
    ```

2. deploy accounts with the keys therefrom like this:

    ```bash
    nile setup PRIVATE_KEY_ALIAS_1
    ...
    nile setup PRIVATE_KEY_ALIAS_2
    ...
    nile setup PRIVATE_KEY_ALIAS_3
    ...
    ```

Next, write a script and call `get-accounts` to retrieve and use the deployed accounts.

```python
def run(nre):

    # fetch the list of deployed accounts
    accounts = nre.get_accounts()

    # then
    accounts[0].send(...)

    # or
    alice, bob, *_ = accounts
    alice.send(...)
    bob.send(...)
```

> Please note that the list of accounts includes only those that exist in the local `<network>.accounts.json` file. In a recent release we added a flag to the command, to get predeployed accounts if the network you are connected to is a [starknet-devnet](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet) instance.

### `get-accounts --predeployed`

This flag retrieves the predeployed accounts if the network you are connecting to is a [starknet-devnet](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet) instance.

You can use it either from the cli:

```sh
nile get-accounts --predeployed
```

Or from the nile runtime environment for scripting:

```python
def run(nre):

    # fetch the list of pre-deployed accounts from devnet
    accounts = nre.get_accounts(predeployed=True)

    # then
    accounts[0].send(...)

    # or
    alice, bob, *_ = accounts
    alice.send(...)
    bob.send(...)
```

### `get-nonce`

Retrieves the nonce for the given contract address (usually an account).

```sh
nile get-nonce <contract_address>
```

## Short string literals

From [cairo-lang docs](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/how_cairo_works/consts.html#short-string-literals): A short string is a string whose length is at most 31 characters, and therefore can fit into a single field element.

In Nile, arguments to contract calls (calldata) that are neither int nor hex, are treated as short strings and converted automatically to the corresponding felt representation. Because of this, you can run the following from the CLI:

```sh
nile deploy MyToken 'MyToken name' 'MyToken symbol' (...)
```

And this is equivalent to passing the felt representation directly like this:

```sh
nile deploy MyToken 0x4d79546f6b656e206e616d65 0x4d79546f6b656e2073796d626f6c (...)
```

Note that if you want to pass the token name as a hex or an int, you need to provide the felt representation directly because these values are not interpreted as short strings. You can open a python terminal, and import and use the `str_to_felt` util like this:

```python
>>> from nile.utils import str_to_felt
>>>
>>> str_to_felt('any string')
460107418789485453340263
```

## Extending Nile with plugins

Nile has the possibility of extending its CLI and `NileRuntimeEnvironment` functionalities through plugins. For developing plugins for Nile fork [this plugin example](https://github.com/franalgaba/nile-plugin-example) boilerplate and implement your desired functionality with the provided instructions.

### How it works

This implementation takes advantage of the native extensibility features of [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/). Using click and leveraging the Python [entrypoints](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/) we have a simple manner of handling extension natively on Python environments through dependencies. The plugin implementation on Nile looks for specific Python entrypoints constraints for adding commands.

In order for this implementation to be functional, it is needed by the plugin developer to follow some development guidelines defined in this simple plugin example extending Nile for a dummy greet extension. In a brief explanation the guidelines are as follows:

1. Define a Python module that implements a click command or group:

   ```python
   # First, import click dependency
   import click

   # Decorate the method that will be the command name with `click.command`
   @click.command()
   # You can define custom parameters as defined in `click`: https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/options/
   def my_command():
       # Help message to show with the command
       """
       Subcommand plugin that does something.
       """
       # Done! Now implement your custom functionality in the command
       click.echo("I'm a plugin overriding a command!")
   ```

2. Define the plugin entrypoint. In this case using Poetry features in the pyproject.toml file:

   ```sh
   # We need to specify that click commands are Poetry entrypoints of type `nile_plugins`. Do not modify this
   [tool.poetry.plugins."nile_plugins"]
   # Here you specify you command name and location <command_name> = <package_method_location>
   "greet" = "nile_greet.main.greet"
   ```

3. Done!

How to decide if I want to use a plugin or not? Just install / uninstall the plugin dependency from your project :smile:

Finally, after the desired plugin is installed, it will also be automatically available through the `nre`. The plugin developer should be aware of this and design the interface accordingly.
