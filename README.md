# OpenZeppelin Nile ‚õµ

_Navigate your [StarkNet](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/index.html) projects written in [Cairo](https://cairo-lang.org)._

## Getting started

Create a folder for your project and `cd` into it:
```sh
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
```

Create a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and activate it:

```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install `nile`:

```sh
pip install cairo-nile
```

Use `nile` to quickly set up your development environment:

```sh
nile init
...
‚ú®  Cairo successfully installed!
...
‚úÖ Dependencies successfully installed
üóÑ  Creating project directory tree
‚õµÔ∏è Nile project ready! Try running:
```
This command creates the project directory structure and installs `cairo-lang`, `starknet-devnet`, `pytest`, and `pytest-asyncio` for you. The template includes a makefile to build the project (`make build`) and run tests (`make test`).

## Usage
### `node`

Run a local [`starknet-devnet`](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/) node:

```sh
nile node

 * Serving Flask app 'starknet_devnet.server' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://localhost:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### `compile`

Compile Cairo contracts. Compilation articacts are written into the `artifacts/` directory.

```sh
nile compile # compiles all contracts under contracts/
nile compile contracts/MyContract.cairo # compiles single contract
```
Example output:
```
$ nile compile
Creating artifacts/abis/ to store compilation artifacts
ü§ñ Compiling all Cairo contracts in the contracts/ directory
üî® Compiling contracts/Account.cairo
üî® Compiling contracts/Initializable.cairo
üî® Compiling contracts/Ownable.cairo
‚úÖ Done
```

### `deploy`
```sh
nile deploy contract --alias my_contract

üöÄ Deploying contract
üåï artifacts/contract.json successfully deployed to 0x07ec10eb0758f7b1bc5aed0d5b4d30db0ab3c087eba85d60858be46c1a5e4680
üì¶ Registering deployment as my_contract in localhost.deployments.txt
```

A few things to notice here:

1. `nile deploy <contract_name>` looks for an artifact with the same name
2. This created a `localhost.deployments.txt` file storing all data related to my deployment
3. The `--alias` parameter lets me create an unique identifier for future interactions, if no alias is set then the contract's address can be used as identifier
4. By default Nile works on local, but you can pass `--network mainnet` to deploy directly to a public chain! Notice that `mainnet` refers to StarkNet main chain, that's settled on Goerli testnet of Ethereum ([mainnet deployment this month!](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-alpha-is-coming-to-mainnet-b825829eaf32))

### `setup`
You can find an exemple `env.` file in `example.env`. These are private keys only to be used for testing and never in production.

```sh
nile setup PKEY1

üöÄ Deploying Account
üåï artifacts/Account.json successfully deployed to 0x07db6b52c8ab888183277bc6411c400136fe566c0eebfb96fffa559b2e60e794
üì¶ Registering deployment as account-0 in localhost.deployments.txt
Invoke transaction was sent.
Contract address: 0x07db6b52c8ab888183277bc6411c400136fe566c0eebfb96fffa559b2e60e794
Transaction hash: 0x17
```

A few things to notice here:

1. `nile set <env_var>` looks for an environement variable with the same name whose value is a private key
2. This created a `localhost.accounts.json` file storing all data related to accounts management

### `raw-execute`
Execute a transaction through the `Account` associated with the private key used. The syntax is:

```sh
nile raw-execute <env_signer> <contract_address> <contract_method> <args>
```

```sh
nile raw-execute PKEY1 0x0342e...4de4e0 transfer_ownership 0x07db6...60e794

Invoke transaction was sent.
Contract address: 0x03420417e09260947e3412d48952858a376f2d3ddde4e49f5981a2e41f4de4e0
Transaction hash: 0x1c
```

### `send`
Acts like `raw-execute` with the exception you can use it like you would use `nile invoke`.
Execute a transaction through the `Account` associated with the private key used. The syntax is:

```sh
nile send <env_signer> <contract_identifier> <contract_method> [PARAM_1, PARAM2...]
```

```sh
nile send PKEY1 ownable0 transfer_ownership 0x07db6...60e794

Invoke transaction was sent.
Contract address: 0x07db6b52c8ab888183277bc6411c400136fe566c0eebfb96fffa559b2e60e794
Transaction hash: 0x1c
```

### `call` and `invoke`
Using `call` and `invoke`, we can perform read and write operations against our local node (or public one using the `--network mainnet` parameter). The syntax is:

```
nile <command> <contract_identifier> <contract_method> [PARAM_1, PARAM2...]
```

Where `<command>` is either `call` or `invoke` and `<contract_identifier>` is either our contract address or alias, as defined on `deploy`.

```sh
nile invoke my_contract increase_balance 1

Invoke transaction was sent.
Contract address: 0x07ec10eb0758f7b1bc5aed0d5b4d30db0ab3c087eba85d60858be46c1a5e4680
Transaction hash: 0x1
```

```sh
nile call my_contract get_balance

1
```

### `clean`
Deletes the `artifacts/` directory for a fresh start ‚ùÑÔ∏è

```sh
nile clean

üöÆ Deleting localhost.deployments.txt
üöÆ Deleting artifacts directory
‚ú® Workspace clean, keep going!
```

### `install`
Install the latest version of the Cairo language and the starknet-devnet local node.

```sh
nile install
```

### `version`
Print out the Nile version

```sh
nile version
```

## Hacking on Nile

Nile uses tox to manage development tasks, you can get a list of
available task with `tox -av`.

 * Install a development version of the package with `python -m pip install .`
 * Run tests with `tox`
 * Build the package with `tox -e build`
 * Format all files with `tox -e format`
 * Check files formatting with `tox -e lint`
